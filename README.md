## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++20 compatible compiler (e.g., MSVC, GCC, Clang)
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) for dependency management
- [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) for project generation
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) (install via vcpkg)

### Setup and Build Instructions

#### 1. Install Dependencies with vcpkg

Make sure you have [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) installed and integrated with your compiler/IDE.

Install Raylib and any other dependencies: vcpkg install raylib

#### 2. Generate Project Files with Premake5

This project uses [Premake5](https://premake.github.io/) to generate project files.

- Download Premake5 and place the executable in your PATH or project root.
- In the project root, run: premake5 vs2022


This will generate a Visual Studio 2022 solution. For other IDEs or build systems, use the appropriate Premake5 action (e.g., `premake5 gmake2` for GNU Makefiles).

#### 3. Build and Run

- Open the generated solution/project in your IDE (e.g., Visual Studio 2022).
- Build the project.
- Run the executable.

### Project Structure

- Source code is in the main directory.
- Asset files (images, sounds, music) should be placed in the `immagini/` directory as referenced in the code.
