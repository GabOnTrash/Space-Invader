# Space-Invader
A game developed in C++ that is simililar to a Space Shooter game... And for now it's my biggest project so far!

** PLATFORM SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**
To run, this game needs the VC++20 or above runtime libraries, otherwise the game will not function proprerly, due to the usage of functions like std::clamp ecc...
